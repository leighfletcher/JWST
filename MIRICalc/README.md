L.N. Fletcher (February 2017)

* Calculated for nadir viewing.
* Not all known gases are included here.
* No scattering, aerosols for Jupiter are purely absorbing, no aerosols for
Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune.
* The 4-7 micron region is highly uncertain for the Ice Giants.
* Surface brightness in Jy/arcsec^2.
